# Subject Matter Impact Site
My Hackbright Academy capstone project. 

## Description

Technical training teams consult with software engineers and product managers as subject matter experts (SMEs) to develop on-demand training lessons. These lessons are deployed via a Learning Management System (LMS) from the vendor Skilljar. This LMS does not have a feature to track which SMEs correlate to lessons. My goal was to develop a simple site where technical trainers (the users) can look up, add, or delete a SME, then via an API call, bring back the name of a lesson and the number of enrollments it has had. This data is useful when looping back with SMEs to advise them on the impact of their trainings and to encourage them to co-create more lessons.

## Roadmap
Future enhancements to this project include: 
<li>limiting users to company emails only</li>
<li>implementing flow to interface with Human Resource Management System (HRMS) to provide this data to SME’s manager as positive feedback, to be used perhaps during SME’s annual performance review or OKR assessments</li>
<li>functionality that reflects courses with more than 1 SME</li>
